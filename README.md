# Bloodline: Spirits of the Smokies — Static Site Bundle

This zip contains a deploy-ready static landing page using Tailwind via CDN.
Open `index.html` in a browser, or upload the folder to any static host (Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, etc.).

## Replace Images
Put your DALL·E renders into `/images/` and keep the same filenames:
- `smokies-hero.png` — hero background
- `judah-portrait.png` — hook portrait
- `velandor.png` — world card 1
- `arthmon.png` — world card 2
- `watcher.png` — world card 3
- `author-desk.png` — author ambient

All current files are placeholders.

## DALL·E Prompt Suite
Prompts are included in `/press/prompts/` as .txt files. Tweak to taste, render 16:9 (or portrait for Judah).

## Customize
- Edit text directly in `index.html` (look for comments and sections).
- Wire the subscribe form action to your ESP (Substack, Mailchimp, Beehiiv, Ko‑Fi, Buttondown, etc.).

## Press Kit (Optional)
Add a one-sheet PDF and sample chapter in `/press/`. Link targets are already present in the page.

Enjoy the fog and folklore.
